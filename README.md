# SerpentComputer
A really simple CPU, has a 16 bit and 8 bit version implemented in python, with python assemblers.

Also under legacy is the tools needed to interact  with an 8 bit version of this machine implemented in minecraft

Will add schematics and firmware for a CPLD based implementations of these CPUs
